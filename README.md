## Introduction
Oracle Autonomous Database provides a fully automated cloud database service that eliminates manual database management tasks, reduces operational costs, enhances security through automatic patching and encryption, and enables businesses to rapidly scale and optimize their data processing and analytics.

Autonomous Database runs natively on OCI, Azure (Oracle Database@Azure) and Google Cloud (Oracle Database@Google Cloud). Modernize and deliver powerful new apps that leverage Oracle Database 23ai with other cloud services services:
* Build new cloud native apps using built-in integrations, such as Kubernetes, AI, DevOps and more
* Enhance existing apps with natural language and other generative AI capabilities.
* Quickly react to business demands using one converged, fully automated database thatâ€™s optimized for all workloads and data formats.

Use these samples to deploy Autonomous Database on cloud providers using APIs. Then, check out the SQL samples that leverage both Autonomous Database cloud integration and converged database capabiltities.
